# EtherBridge Bank:Efficient Ethereum Transactions


Welcome to the **EtherBridge Bank:Efficient Ethereum Transactions** project repository. This project demonstrates the integration of Ethereum blockchain technology with a decentralized web application. By following the setup instructions below, you can explore the basic functionalities of a decentralized bank, including deposits and withdrawals, all powered by smart contracts and the Ethereum network.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring the Ethereum Bank Web App, follow these setup instructions:

1. **Machine Setup**: Set up your local environment to connect to the Ethereum network. Since this is a sample project, we'll be connecting to the Ethereum test network.

2. **Decentralized Connection**: Ethereum, being a decentralized blockchain, requires us to connect to it using tools like the MetaMask browser extension. Install MetaMask and create an account to interact with decentralized applications.

3. **Gas Fees and Ethers**: In Ethereum, transactions require gas fees. To test transactions, you'll need ethers in your MetaMask account. Visit the [Rinkeby Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) to receive free ethers by sharing a public post with your address.

4. **Smart Contract Code**: Head to the [Remix-Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to write the smart contract code in Solidity. This code defines the functionality of our Ethereum Bank.

## Bank App Functionality

In the Ethereum Bank Web App, you'll find a simple yet powerful bank application with the following features:

- **Deposit and Withdrawal**: Users can deposit and withdraw ethers into and from their accounts via the web interface.

- **Metamask Confirmation**: Every transaction is confirmed through MetaMask, ensuring the security and authenticity of each action. Users will need to approve transactions using their MetaMask account.

- **Gas Fee**: As with all Ethereum transactions, gas fees are involved. Users will see the gas fee associated with each action and confirm it through MetaMask.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your local environment to connect to the Ethereum test network.
3. Install MetaMask and create an account.
4. Obtain free ethers from the Rinkeby Faucet by sharing a public post.
5. Write and deploy the smart contract code on the Remix-Ethereum IDE.
6. Launch the Ethereum Bank Web App and experience the deposit and withdrawal functionalities.
