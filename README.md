# Ether_Bank_Web_App

1. First we need to set up our machine so that we can connect it to the Ethereum Network.
2. As it is a sample project so we don't need to connect it to the main network. We can connect it to the test network.
3. As Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain and browsers work with the centralized system, we need to connect to the decentralized system.
4. For this to happen we can connect to a plugin named Metamask and create an account on it.
5. As every transaction requires a gas fee, therefore we need to have some ethers in our Metamask account.
6. For this we can visit this website: "https://faucet.rinkeby.io/", make a public post on Twitter or Facebook with your public address, then copy the URL of the post and paste it on this website to get free ethers deposited on your account.
7. Next we can visit the Remix-Ethereum IDE: "https://remix.ethereum.org/", where we can write the smart contract code in solidity language to make our web app work.
8. Here a Bank app will be created with the basic functionalities of Deposit and Withdrawal and every time a user Deposits or Withdraws the Ether they will have to confirm the transaction from their Metamask amount, gas fee will be charged and the transaction will be completed.
